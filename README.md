# Bayesian Regression Models
Model Comparison of 2-Component Mixture, 3-Component Mixture, and Bayesian Linear Regression with MCMC Sampling for a Bimodal Joint Posterior Distribution.

I was given a dataset with no information about where the data came from. My job was to find useful statistics and uncover the the underlying model.

Please refer to Bayesian-Regression-Analysis.pdf for more information on the data and R scripts.
